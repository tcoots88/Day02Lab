    <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
    <p> I am originally from California, but have lived in Georgia for the past 4 years. I am married and have a 4 year
      old daughter.
      During my time in the Air Force, I was trained to be a Pashto Language Analyst but also had the opportunity to
      serve as a
      Mission Manager, a Language Analyst Supervisor/Trainer, a Quality Controller, and an Element Leader. Prior to
      joining the Air Force,
      I did not have any type of formal language training, but the teachers at the Defense Language Institute in
      Monterey, CA had put together
      a terrific program so that even someone like myself could pick up Pashto.
    </p>
    <p> I have two Associates degrees which I gained while I was in the Air Force. My first one was gained from the
      Defense Language Institute
      and is in Pashto Language Studies. My second degree was gained from the Community College of the Air Force and is
      in Intelligence Studies.
