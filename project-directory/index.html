      <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
      <p>   I am originally from California, but have lived in Georgia for the past 4 years.  I am married and have a 4 year old daughter.  
          During my time in the Air Force, I was trained to be a Pashto Language Analyst but also had the opportunity to serve as a
          Mission Manager, a Language Analyst Supervisor/Trainer, a Quality Controller, and an Element Leader.  Prior to joining the Air Force,
          I did not have any type of formal language training, but the teachers at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA had put together 
          a terrific program so that even someone like myself could pick up Pashto.  
      </p>
      <p>   I have two Associates degrees which I gained while I was in the Air Force.  My first one was gained from the Defense Language Institute
          and is in Pashto Language Studies.  My second degree was gained from the Community College of the Air Force and is in Intelligence Studies.
